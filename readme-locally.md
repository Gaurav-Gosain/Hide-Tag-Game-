-------------------------------------------------------How to run the game locally---------------------------------------------------------
How to completely run our code to show our game on the node server.
-npm install --save
-nodemon --experimental-modules app.mjs 
This will create a local port within the browser and allow you, the user, to run the game locally. For multiple players on local severs you
can open up a new window would reperesent another player from another pc, after 3 players the game will start. You may join the same game
using the local host. Making new tabs to join will not work you will need to join through a new window. 

---------------------------------------------------------------Database--------------------------------------------------------------------
When you run the server locally you may login, and use your username and password to join. There is no sign up so everytime you log in it 
will create a new instance. The code on the live server will save to the database but it will not work as it does on local servers.
